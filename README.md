## 4. Executive Summary

The DJ Booking Platform is a modern, professional event management web application designed to simplify the process of hiring DJs for any kind of event â€” from house parties to grand weddings. It aims to provide an intuitive user interface where users can search, filter, and book a DJ based on their location, event type, and availability.

* This platform provides structured visibility for DJs and convenience for customers
* Market lacks streamlined, reliable DJ booking platforms
